# Ocean-Relief
Ocean Relief is an idea I had for an ocean resort with an expensive feel. The design incorporates a unique "shimmer" when ctas scroll onto the screen. The site uses modern CSS such as clamp and fully embrasses SCSS functionality by making use of varlaibles, functions , mixins, etc. The site is fully responsive WITHOUT media queries by changing the font-size and padding based on available spacing and using clamp to restrict the amount of characters in a line. Site is currently unfinished but it is worth taking a look at the concept.

Again, fully responsive WITHOUT media queries.
