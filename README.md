# Ocean-Relief
Ocean Relief is an idea I had for an ocean resort with an expensive feel. The design incorporates a unique "shimmer" when ctas scroll onto the screen.
The site uses modern CSS such as clamp and fully embrasses SCSS functionality by making use of varlaibles, functions , mixins, etc. 
The site is fully responsive WITHOUT media queries.

TODO:
  1. Finish the site, The footer is currently unstyled.
